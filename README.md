# GPT-2 Spam Classifier from Scratch

This project contains the implementation of a GPT-2 model from scratch using PyTorch. The project involves building the GPT-2 architecture, loading pre-trained GPT-2 weights, and fine-tuning the model for spam classification. This is primarily for learning purposes.

To run the code in this project, you'll need the following packages:

- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow>=2.15.0`
- `tqdm>=4.66`
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `numpy`
